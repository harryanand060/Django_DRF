# Django Restful API For Authentication
Django restful api login with Email and Mobile no. In this we get custom created authentication system.
We can register with our mobile or email after register verification OTP sent to email and mobile.
Both email and mobile has different OTP. so when user input the OTP from email then email verified and
if OTP input from mobile then mobile varified. User also sent the resent OTP if mail or SMS not found.
